# Zomato-Data-Analys

This project analyzes a dataset from Zomato to answer specific business-related questions. Using Python in Jupyter Notebook, I applied several data visualization techniques to uncover insights such as the most popular restaurant types, customer ratings, and voting patterns. Key tasks include:

Data cleaning and handling using pandas (e.g., converting ratings to numerical values).
Visualizing restaurant types using count plots.
Plotting total votes received by restaurant type.
Exploring the distribution of restaurant ratings via histograms.
Analyzing spending by couples using a count plot.
Investigating the relationship between online orders and ratings using box plots.
Using a heatmap to show the distribution of online and offline orders across restaurant types.
